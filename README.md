🌐 Portfolio Website
This is my full-stack developer portfolio, built to showcase not just my technical skills but also my creativity, problem-solving mindset, and DevOps capabilities. It’s more than a static site—I'm actively enhancing it with backend features, CI/CD pipelines, and multi-platform deployment strategies.

🚀 Features
- ✅ Responsive, mobile-first design using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
- 🧠 Flask backend with dynamic features like a contact form and visitor counter
- 🔁 CI/CD pipeline using Google Cloud Build and Artifact Registry
- 🌍 Deployed on Google Cloud Run with a custom domain
- 🌐 Exploring multi-platform hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages, Cloud Run, Netlify)
