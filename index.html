  <h3 class="text-center mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-top: 80px;">Welcome to my first Portfolio Website</h3>

  <p>I'm very excited to display my first Portfolio Website. I'd like to credit my mentors at <em>CodeCademy</em>, and
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/135171.Jon_Duckett" target="_blank"><em>Jon Duckett</em> </a>, who
    wrote a very helpful book called: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10361330-html-and-css"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><cite>HTML & CSS Design and Build Websites</cite> </a>. Both sources
    have been extremely helpful in my learning with building this website.
  </p>

  <p>First off CodeCademy has a very diverse range of education paths, with affiliations with the biggest tech companies
    in the industry.</p>

  <p>I originally followed the advice of Jon Duckett by using <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/"
      target="_blank"><em>Notepad</em> </a> and linking it to a <i>.html</i> file to simulate a text editor, and project
    window setting. I later migrated my code to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"><em>Visual
        Studio Code</em> </a> as advised by CodeCademy. This is where I staged everything before committing to a Domain
    Name to optimise annual subscription cost fees, and to avoid code alteration complications.</p>

  <p>As advised from my many mentors, I need to show my practical skills to accompany my certifications. <a
      href="https://www.cloudskillsboost.google" target="_blank"><em>Google Skills Boost</em> </a>, <a
      href="https://skillbuilder.aws" target="_blank"><em>AWS Skill Builder</em> </a>, <a
      href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank"><em>CodeCademy</em> </a>, and others provide many practical
    exercises or labs, which I have completed hundreds collectively. My objective for building independent projects is
    to validate a fusion of my theoretical and practical learning capabilities.</p>

  <p>Before diving into my first cloud project: Hosting a Static Website on AWS, I decided to build this portfolio as a
    foundation. It felt more meaningful to showcase my story through my own design. Instead of using a default site, I
    decided to take a slight, fun, creative detour, and here we are.</p>

  <p>I like to look at the whole picture of everything in all of my research. So I see everything as relevant and
    another building block of education and experience. I don't see the point of learning the Back End without learning
    about the Front End, as both bring clarity to each other.</p>

  <p>Although Static Websites have no Back End relation directly, they resemble the finished product of Front End
    development. I will use embellishment tags throughout where I see appropriate.</p>

  <p>This is going to be a gradual process as I'm starting with HTML to structure my pages. I will later proceed to
    style my pages with CSS as the weeks progress. I really appreciate your interest in my website, and I hope to hear
    from you soon.</p>
